# Accenture-stock-price-prediction-using-time-series-analysis
In this project I have used arima time analysis to predict stock-prices for the company. For this project the exogeneous variables used were moving average_close[50], moving average_close[20], moving average_open[50], moning average_open[20] and the Best model was ARIMA(2,0,3)(0,0,0)[0] intercept.
